# Genetic Maze

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-completed-brightgreen)

A C project implementing a **Genetic Algorithm** for maze navigation, where individuals evolve to find the optimal path to the exit.

---

## 📌 About the Project

This project uses evolutionary computation techniques to solve maze navigation problems. Each individual has a chromosome encoding movements on the map, and evolution occurs through selection, crossover, and mutation.

## ⚙️ Features

- Individual represented by a chromosome containing movements:  
  - `U` - Up  
  - `D` - Down  
  - `L` - Left  
  - `R` - Right
- Simulation of the path in the maze considering collisions and map boundaries.
- Control of visible movements from the starting position via a queue of valid moves.
- Full Genetic Algorithm: selection, crossover, mutation, and population evolution.
- Fitness evaluation based on distance to the exit, steps taken, and success.
- Generation of graphs and reports for analyzing results.
